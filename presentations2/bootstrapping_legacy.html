		<title>Pulling Up Your Legacy By Its Bootstraps</title>

		<meta name="description"
			  content="Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to support an application built on an older framework. Upgrading isn't an option. The code is untested and nowhere near best practices or standards. In this session we'll talk about strategies to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to add features and functionality and retiring the older code in pieces. We'll review specific examples and code from a real project where we bootstrapped an early CodeIgniter app.">

                        <li>Leave a codebase untouched for a long time</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <li>Code that was left alone </li>
                        <li>Sometimes our application is built on a framework or uses a package that cannot be upgraded easily</li>
                        <li>We touch it as little as possible; treat it as fragile</li>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li>When we are developing an application without a clear picture of the problem or under a tight deadline, we are creating technical debt</li>
                        <li>If we patch an application we don't "know" we are usually making tech debt</li>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li>At State, our students develop many simple apps. They are great for learning/teaching.</li>
                        <li>Our dept can't get enough of the instant gratification of building a tool that helps someone do their job.</li>
                        <li>But does it help our whole organization?</li>
                        <li>Prof developers know it will eventually bite us. That simple app that one person uses will
                            break and need an urgent fix, when we're working on something else.</li>
                        <li>The student who built it won't be here anymore. </li>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <li>many developers have touched the code => archaeology => a spaghetti monster</li>
                        <li>Many of these apps have grown too big to be maintained by students. The
                            users are too high on the org chart to risk failure or let the app die.</li>

                        <li>In my experience, bootstrapping gives you options beyond the black and white rewrite or refactor</li>
                        <li>When do we get the opportunity to refactor an application without new features being needed?</li>
                        <li>Bootstrapping is a combination of refactoring and new features; </li>
                        <li>it allows you to modernize your legacy application without replacing the whole thing.</li>

                        <li>It organizes requirements for scholarships to be awarded to Students in the COE</li>
                        <li>All development was in production.</li>
                        <li>The codebase was an early version of Code Igniter. But that fact really doesn't mean much.
                            It was an MVC application implemented by a student who didn't really understand how to use MVC.</li>
                        <li>The application was used most of the Academic year, so that gave me a month at the end of the summer to
                            "FIX IT", test it, and have it ready for the next Academic year. </li>
                        <li>This month was a gift, they wanted me to do it in two weeks.</li>

                            One of my coworkers was able to put these pieces together, and we perfected it during this project.

                                'student_info' databases to allow our queries to continue working regardless of the server</li>
