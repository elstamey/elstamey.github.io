### Supporting Legacy is Hard

 <blockquote><p>"It's harder to read code than to write it. This is why code reuse is so hard." 
 <br>- Joel Spolsky</p></blockquote>

--

### Why Bootstrapping is important

- A lot of web development work involves supporting **legacy** applications

- It is HARD to justify **refactoring**  

- **Bootstrapping** gives you flexibility to support your application

**Let's review some terminology... (source: wikipedia)**

--

### Legacy Software

Software developed using older technologies and practices.  It can be difficult to replace because of its wide use.

Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as "legacy" often implies that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.

--

### Spaghetti Code

The relationships between pieces of code are so tangled, it’s nearly impossible to add or change something without unpredictably breaking something.

    
--

### Lasagna code

Lasagna code is code that has way too many layers.  

In Object Oriented programming, this means code that has many really small classes when a few slightly larger classes would have done the trick.

--



### Refactor

Technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure **without changing its external behavior**.

--

### Technical Debt

A metaphor referring to the eventual consequences of any system design, software architecture or software development within a codebase.



--



### Bootstrapping

In software this usually means, **building onto an existing system** for the purpose of improvement with the least amount of sweat equity and development cost in the process.

--

### Why Bootstrapping is important

- A lot of web development work involves supporting **legacy** applications

- It is HARD to justify **refactoring**  

- **Bootstrapping** gives you flexibility to support your application

The Project: Scholarships

--

### The Project: Scholarships

- Engineering **Foundation** receives money from donors to give to **students**
- Students apply each year giving information about themselves
- **Donors** specify criteria/rules for students to receive money
    - The information in a student's application helps them match to scholarships
- **Selection Committee** selects Candidates to receive money
- **Scholarship Coordinator** reports these Recipients to Financial Aid
- **Financial Aid** awards the money
--



### How to Bootstrap

1. Survey Your Application

    Legacy projects have business value baked in, that you must preserve.

2. Organize the Work to be done

    Based on the bugs, new features, etc.  You have to balance needs vs. wants to deliver this product.

### Survey Your Application

1. Talk to users of the application 

2. Study the codebase

3. Examine the new feature requests

--

### Survey Your Application

1. Talk to users of the application 

2. Study the codebase

3. Examine the new feature requests

--


### Talk to Users of the Application

1. Is their process consistent with the application?  

2. What are the pain points?

3. Do they have concerns with the application?

**Don’t rely on developer feedback**


-- choose1 


### Talk to Users of the Application

1. Is their process consistent with the application?  

2. What are the pain points?

3. Do they have concerns with the application?


--
### User Feedback: Scholarship Process

**Process was inconsistent with the application**

- Selection Committee used a spreadsheet of available scholarship money 
 
- Selected Candidates were added to a spreadsheet Student ID and Amount and Term of award 

--

### Talk to Users of the Application

1. Is their process consistent with the application?  

2. What are the pain points?

3. Do they have concerns with the application?


--
### User Feedback: Scholarship Pain Points

**High Margin of Error**  

Their process was exiting and re-entering the system through spreadsheets

--

### Talk to Users of the Application

1. Is their process consistent with the application?  

2. What are the pain points?

3. Do they have concerns with the application?


--
### User Feedback: Scholarship Concerns

- They didn’t trust that Selection Committee was choosing the best candidates

- The Scoring algorithm was not clear/effective

- Multiple majors weren't allowed by our system

- **NOT ALL MONEY WAS BEING AWARDED**

- **MONEY LEFT UN-GIVEN ⇒ ANGRY DONORS**



--

### Survey Your Application

1. Talk to users of the application 

2. Study the codebase

3. Examine the new feature requests

--

### Study the codebase

- Talk to past/current developers

- Verify that key functionality does what everyone thinks it does

- Look for entanglements 

--
### Codebase of Scholarship

- Large App model

    - SQL queries, only slightly dynamic

    - Functions weren’t single-purpose

    - No Bounded Contexts between Students, Selection, and Foundation

--
### Codebase of Scholarship

- Student data was a single row in table

   - Academic information wasn’t updated when it changed
   
   - Major was a single column in that row

--

### Survey Your Application

1. Talk to users of the application 

2. Study the codebase

3. Examine the new feature requests

--

### Examine New Feature Requests

- What new features are needed?  

- How they might be implemented?

--
### New Features: Scholarships

- Explicit criteria matching, excluded non-matching applicants

- Current student data, query their GPA, Major, etc at time of selection

- Students have multiple majors

--

### How to Bootstrap

1. Survey Your Application

    Legacy projects have business value baked in, that you must preserve.

2. Organize the Work to be done

    Based on the bugs, new features, etc.  You have to balance needs vs. wants to deliver this product.

--

### Decision Time

- Is there another application that can do what it does?  Is it better?

- Is this a worthwhile investment?

- If so, what are the Most Valuable Features?

--

### Build Trust with Users

- Explain why this work is necessary

- Be open about errors in the application

--

### Set Expectations

- Customer has an open door to you 

    - add work from the side 

    - change processes

- Keep the door open anyway!

--

### Scope the work to be done
- Bootstrapping grows FAST!

- Large projects 

    - require more people to be engaged in the process
    
    - wear people down over time



--



### How to Organize the work

- Use your Research 

- Prioritize the needs

- Scope the work you are agreeing to do


--
### Plan Features for Scholarships

Divided the application based on first need in the process

1. Student Application

2. Funding

3. Selection

4. Reports for Funding and Scholarship Coordinator

    **we didn't scope the work**


--
Mitigate Risk 

--

### Control Risk Before Bootstrapping

- Version control

    Stabilize the code base and preserves history

- Development and Staging environments (w/ Fake data)

    **No more developing in production!!!!**

--



### Control Risk Before Bootstrapping

- Involve Users to work through the process

- Keep the constant feedback loop

-- 

### Test Everything You Need

- Acceptance tests stabilize functionality you need

    - added hooks for testing interfaces 

    - Codeception needed to view contents of the pages

- Unit and Functional tests for everything you build

<!------>

<!--### Bootstrap-->

<!--- Initial Bootstrapping-->

<!--- Ongoing Bootstrapping-->

<!--Customize to the needs of your project.-->

-- 

### Database Migrations: Phinx

- Allows you to change DB across evironments

- Gives you power to undo the change if there is a problem

` $ vendor/bin/phinx create CreateUserLoginsTable`

--
<?php
    
    use Phinx\Migration\AbstractMigration;
    
    class CreateUserLoginsTable extends AbstractMigration
    {
        /**
        * Example One: Change
        */
        public function change()
        {
            // create the table
            $table = $this->table('user_logins');
            $table->addColumn('user_id', 'integer')
                  ->addColumn('created', 'datetime')
                  ->create();
        }
    
        /**
        * Example Two: Up/Down with Migrate/Rollback
        */
        public function up()
        {
            $table = $this->table('users');
                    $table->renameColumn('bio', 'biography');
        }
    
        /**
         * Migrate Down.
         */
        public function down()
        {
             $table = $this->table('users');
                    $table->renameColumn('biography', 'bio');
        }
    }

-- 

### Database Migrations: Phinx

` $ vendor/bin/phinx migrate`

` $ vendor/bin/phinx rollback`

-- 

### Configuration file

- DB connections

- Base URL 

- Set paths to twig templates

- Customize Notice messages

- Set config variables for services

### Bootstrapping Scholarships: Filetree

- new code in `/src` alongside the `/app` directory

![File tree](img/FileTree.png) 

--
### Bootstrapping Scholarships: Composer

- `/src` is given a namespace

- namespaces are autoloaded in composer

![Composer File](img/composer.json.png)

--
### Composer packages

- Phinx for database migrations
- Illuminate database
- Twig templates
- Testing packages (Codeception, PHPUnit, Mockery)
- Moneyphp for handling currency
- Pimple containers



--
### Bootstrapping Scholarships: Connecting the Dots
 
- `/app/bindings.php` 
define containers for each of the new Services, Repositories, Projections

- `/app/controllers`  
new controllers for the new functionality

- `/app/services.php` 
defined and configured twig, database, et al 


--
Containers

--
### Containers

`/app/bindings.php`

        <?php
        
        use /Scholarships/Selection/Infrastructure/Storage/HybridSourcedScholarshipRepository;
        
        $container['/Scholarships/Selection/Domain/Scholarship/ScholarshipRepository'] = function($c) {
            return new HybridSourcedScholarshipRepository(
                $c['ScholarshipsSupportEventsEventStore'],
                $c['database'],
                $c['ScholarshipsCommonServicesDepartmentsService'],

Controllers

--
### Controllers

        class Selectionnext extends BaseController
        {
            public function Selectionnext()
            {
                parent::BaseController();
        
                $this->scholarshipRepository = $this->container['Scholarships/Selection/Domain/Scholarship/ScholarshipRepository'];
            }
        protected function scholarshipsDashboard($scholarshipId)
        {
            $committeeMember = $this->getCommitteeMember();
        
            $scholDetails = $this->getScholarshipDashboard($scholarshipId);
        
            $this->render('pages/scholarship-details.twig', array("scholarship" => $scholDetails)));
        }
        
        
        private function getScholarshipDashboard($scholarshipId,$keepItLight=false)
        {
         $committeeMember = $this->getCommitteeMember();
        
         $presenter = new ScholarshipDashboardPresenter(
         $committeeMember,
         ScholarshipId::fromString($scholarshipId),
         $this->events,
         $this->scholarshipRepository,
         $this->container['Scholarships/Selection/Domain/ApplicantQueryService']
         );
        
         $scholDetails = $presenter->asArrayForJson();
         $scholDetails['json_string'] = json_encode($scholDetails);
        
         return $scholDetails;
        }
        ?>


--
### Bootstrap the application

Within CodeIgniter

- New Controllers for new functionality

- Bindings for CodeIgniter to find the new code

- New Twig templates beside the existing Views in `/app`

--
### Summary: Scholarship Wins!

- Restored confidence in selection process!

- Fewer awards were rejected!

- More Scholarship Money was awarded than ever before!

**By May 2015:  Approximately $1,074,394 Awarded for 2015-16**

--
### Summary: Lessons Learned

- Huge time investment (approx. 9 months to complete selection) With more work over the summer to complete

- Over time we lost participation because we have too many other projects needing attention

- Tight deadlines with un-scoped work, we created technical debt that we would have to address in the next academic year

--
### Summary: Was It Worth It?

**University is replacing it this year**

- We learned a lot of new techniques
    - bootstrap  
    - event sourcing
    - Domain-Driven Design
    - Command Query Response Segregation
    - managing projects
    - A LOT!
