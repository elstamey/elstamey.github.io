    <title>Pulling Up Your Legacy By Its Bootstraps</title>

    <meta name="description"
          content="Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to support an application built on an older framework. Upgrading isn't an option. The code is untested and nowhere near best practices or standards. In this session we'll talk about strategies to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to add features and functionality and retiring the older code in pieces. We'll review specific examples and code from a real project where we bootstrapped an early CodeIgniter app.">

                <li>I began using PHP in 1999. Most of the web applications I have worked on have
                involved starting with someone else's work</li>
                <li>My group in the College of Engineering: includes 3 developers, a UX person, about 5 part-time student developers

                <li>We support a pile of PHP applications.</li>

            <aside class="notes">
                <li>Starting with someone else's code is hard</li>
                <li>Our tendency, as developers, is to replace it with more familiar code, our own.</li>
                <li>But  these legacy applications have grown beyond simple CRUD applications and now have a lot of
                business logic baked in.</li>
                <li>It is important that we develop the skills to read other code and fix only what is needed.</li>

            <h3>Why Bootstrapping is important</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A lot of web development work involves supporting <strong>legacy</strong> applications</p></li>
                <li><p>It is HARD to justify <strong>refactoring</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Bootstrapping</strong> gives you flexibility to support your application</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Let&#39;s review some terminology... (source: wikipedia)</strong></p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <!--<li>Chances are good that  you are working with a legacy application.</li>-->
                <!--<li>Convincing managers to let us refactor code that isn't VISIBLY broken is hard</li>-->
                <!--<li>Learning to bootstrap the legacy codebase gives you options beyond replacing the whole thing.</li>-->
                <li>But before we begin, let's review these terms to make sure we're on the same page.</li>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Legacy Software</h3>
            <p>Software developed using older technologies and practices. It can be difficult to replace because of its
                wide use.</p>
            <p>Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as &quot;legacy&quot; often implies that the system is out
                of date or in need of replacement.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>A legacy app was developed using older strategies </li>
                <li>...is probably very important to its users</li>
                <li>In PHP:
                    <ul>
                        <li>spaghetti code that uses includes ...</li>
                        <li>frameworks/cms ...</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Spaghetti Code</h3>
            <p>The relationships between pieces of code are so tangled, it’s nearly impossible to add or change
                something without unpredictably breaking something.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>Spaghetti code is when the code is tangled with itself</li>
                <li>It's tough to change without causing ripples throughout your app</li>
                <li>older PHP with the includes is spaghetti because the html, style, php, and DB queries are mixed </li>
                <li>This also applies to code that doesn't meet the Single Responsibility principle.</li>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Lasagna code</h3>
            <p>Lasagna code is code that has way too many layers. </p>
            <p>In Object Oriented programming, this means code that has many really small classes when a few slightly
                larger classes would have done the trick.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>I truly believe Lasagna Code was a term made to perpetuate the pasta metaphor, to further the gluten-free cause</li>
                <li>Applies to unbalanced code with classes that are either too large or too small.</li>
                <li>A good lasagna has balanced layers.</li>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Refactor</h3>
            <p>Technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure <strong>without
                changing its external behavior</strong>.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>Refactoring is a term often misused. </li>
                <li>You are changing the code without altering the application's behavior.</li>
                <li>You can make improvements to the code, etc without altering what the user sees
                and does.</li>
                <li>Once you change behavior, it's not refactoring. </li>
                <li>This is why managers don't really support it. There is no visible gain FOR THEM or the user.</li>

        <section>
            <h3>Technical Debt</h3>
            <p>A metaphor referring to the eventual consequences of any system design, software architecture or software
                development within a codebase.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>Technical debt is the consequence of the design decisions we make ...</li>
                <li>It is also the consequence of leaving code unmaintained</li>
                <li>Our students develop many simple apps. They are great tools for learning, and they help someone do their job.</li>
                <!--<li>There is an instant gratification about building a tool that helps someone do their job well</li>-->
                <!--<li>Our dept can't get enough of it!</li>-->
                <li>But developers know it will eventually bite us. That simple CRUD app that one person uses will one
                day break and need an urgent fix.</li>
                <li>The student who built it won't be here anymore. </li>
                <li>Sometimes these apps grow </li>
                <li>Unfortunately, this technical debt isn't limited to simple apps. We have larger applications,
                as well, that began as simple apps and grew. </li>
                <li>Even though they were student-built, they've grown too big to be student-maintained. And the
                    users are too high on the org chart to let them die.</li>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
            <p>In software this usually means, <strong>building onto an existing system</strong> for the purpose of
                improvement with the least amount of sweat equity and development cost in the process.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>Bootstrapping is a combination of refactoring and new features; </li>
                <li>it allows you to modernize your legacy application without replacing the whole thing.</li>
            </aside>

                <li>All development was in production.</li>
                <li>The codebase was an early version of Code Igniter. But that fact really doesn't mean much.
                It was an MVC application implemented by a student who didn't really understand how to use MVC.</li>
                <li>The application was used most of the Academic year, so that gave me a month at the end of the summer to
                    "FIX IT", test it, and have it ready for the next Academic year. </li>
                <li>This month was a gift, they wanted me to do it in two weeks.</li>

                    <strong>students</strong></p></li>

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>The Scholarship cycle went a little like this</li>
                <li>Fall, students began applying for the NEXT academic year.</li>
                <li>Their application shared details that would help them match for scholarships</li>
                <li>Donors specify the type of student they want to receive the money, based on majors, gpa, and sometimes clubs</li>
                <li>We call this Scholarship criteria. Some is required and some is optional</li>
                <li>Spring, Foundation figures out the money that is available for each Scholarship</li>
                <li>Selection committee finds candidates to receive that money.</li>
                <li>Scholarship Coordinator gives the information to Financial Aid.  Each award is the amount of money, the recipient, and when the money will be given, the following Fall and/or Spring.</li>

                <li>If an award was rejected, the committee would re-select</li>
                <li>The tool was used throughout the year, made a tight support window.</li>
                <li>We needed to be able to work on the Student Application without affecting the Selection process, but the functionality was in one App model</li>

                <li>We also learned they didn't trust the application or that selection committee was choosing valid
                applicants</li>
                <li>An award could be rejected if a student's enrollment, major, or GPA changed between selection and disbursement Aug/Jan</li>
                <li>When FA rejected the awards, it created mistrust of the selection committee and of the app, even though there was no way the app could predict what students would later do</li>
                <li>Our scoring algorithm had a problem. Early on, they didn't want to exclude applicants, even if they didn't match requirements.</li>
                <li>This meant that a student who matched 2 required and 1 optional criteria, had the same score as
                match against 3 required criteria.</li>
                <li>A selection committee member had to scrutinize the candidates or could choose a bad match.</li>
                <li>It didn't allow multiple majors, and this was causing inconsistent probems.</li>
                <li>Some students, would get their non-COE majors and they couldn't match for dept scholarships</li>
                <li>One year, there was a lot of money that had been left ungiven</li>
                <li>Donors were upset</li>

            <aside class="notes">
                <li>We needed to use version control, first. Our department had just bought Github Enterprise, so we only
                    had to find the private data that was hidden in small scripts before we committed it to the repo.</li>
                <li>Next, we needed development environments that closely matched our production web servers.  This
                    required a vagrant box and puppet configuration files that our group had begun building for the production servers.
                    One of my coworkers was able to put these pieces together, and we perfected it during this project.
                    This saved us from a lot of deployment issues, and we could run the application locally, which had been impossible using MAMP</li>
                <li>Staging space was an easier problem to solve, we just created another vhost on the server. </li>

                <li>Phinx was a criticial tool for us. It gave us the ability to alter our databases using a script.</li>
                <li>Migrations give you the ability to do and undo these DB changes. Any change I made to my DB could
                also be made across the team's development environments, in staging, and production environments.</li>
                <li>If something unexpected happened at any point, it could be undone.</li>
                <li>It basically allowed us to version control DB changes. And although it isn't recommended, we did
                use it extensively for data migrations in addition to schema changes.</li>

                <li>I've included two examples of a Phinx migration:</li>
                <li>First is the change method, which is a single function. Phinx is supposed to know how to do AND undo that
                change, so you don't have to write the undo query.</li>
                <li>However, there are some queries that the change() method doesn't know how to undo.</li>
                <li>Example #2 is the type of migration we generally write. This example renames a DB column from bio to
                biography.</li>
                <li>The down() method undoes this change, renaming the column bio again. Along with this migrations, there
                    would probably be a code change to queries of the 'bio' data.  Those commits would be in a single Pull Request
                    with this migration.  Otherwise the change would break the code</li>
                <li>Tests run after the migration would now pass, and that code could be merged.</li>
                <li>These are the commands you use to migrate or rollback the changes to your database.</li>
