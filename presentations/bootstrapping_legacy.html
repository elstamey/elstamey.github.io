		<title>Pulling Up Your Legacy By Its Bootstraps</title>

		<meta name="description"
			  content="Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to support an application built on an older framework. Upgrading isn't an option. The code is untested and nowhere near best practices or standards. In this session we'll talk about strategies to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to add features and functionality and retiring the older code in pieces. We'll review specific examples and code from a real project where we bootstrapped an early CodeIgniter app.">

                        <li>In my experience, bootstrapping gives you options beyond the black and white rewrite or refactor</li>

                            required a vagrant box and puppet configuration files that our group had begun building for the production servers.</li>

                            wanted to verify the student data stayed the same</li>
